CagateiSoldi is a Telegram bot to manage Netflix's shared account with your friends and family. In english _'cagate i soldi'_ is something like _'give me your money'_.

+ **Easy:** Add the bot to your Netflix's Telegram group, let your friends join the bot's list, set the day the subscription is renewed and you're done.
+ **Reminders:** Every month, on the day your Netflix subscription is renewed, the bot send a notification in your group with the list of people who have to give you money. They could mark themselves as payed, but you, the admin, have to confirm the payment.
+ **Free and Open source:** I really believe in an open source world.
